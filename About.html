            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Elliot Handler, co-founder of Mattel, decided to create a series of die-cast toy cars for boys. His idea was to capture a part of the huge market for small car models that was then dominated by the British company Lesney Products with Matchbox cars. In 1968, 16 cast models were released, 11 of which were designed by Harry Bentley Bradley, and the first produced model was a dark blue custom Camaro. All 16 had "Spectraflame" paint, bearings, Redline wheels, and working suspension. "Hot pink" was not often used on Hot Wheels cars because it was considered a "girl color". To make the cars run quickly on the plastic tracks, Mattel chose a cheap, durable, low-friction plastic called Delrin for the bushings between the axles and the wheels. The "torsion bar" suspension was simple but flawed. Inside the cars, the axles were connected to the chassis in a "C"-like shape. When you pushed down, the axles flexed just like a real car. It was the combination of all these elements -- speed, with the low-friction wheel/axle assemblies and racing tires, looks, with the Spectraflame paint and magnesium rims, and the incorporation of very American themes like hot rod designs based on real American prototypes found in numerous competitors' product lines, that laid the foundation for Hot Wheels' incredible success story.</p>
